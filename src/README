Kalaha AI

The course of action was to first complete the requirements for E-grade.
Youtube videos, the coursebook, and other sources were used to get a deeper understanding of the minimax algorithm.
Whenever we felt more comfortable with the algorithm, then we advanced to the state where we would be able to apply it
to the AI agent.

Implementation:
The agent plays through the game (to some depth level) beforehand and then used the minimax algorithm to recursively
trace back the score, which would represent the best action available.

This kind of learning process was used to understand iterated deep-search and alpha-beta pruning, which
later was implemented to the agent.

To see the difference between e.g. the E-grade and B-grade, the E-agent and the B-agent played against each other,
you can see a substantial difference in performance.
